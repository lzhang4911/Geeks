Exercise on some coding questions

This is the first time, after 20+ years of software development, that I worked on these LeetCode questions. I think it's good because it helped me to put or pick all pieces together! But without a real life project, one could be either overvalued or the other way as well!

If there is any further update here, something bad might have happened :)

Happy coding!
