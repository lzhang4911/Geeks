 * There are a list of such jobs among which some of them may overlap with each other.
 * The profit is not constant per duration. One cannot work on more than one jobs at

 * to work on?
 * 
 * If multiple jobs are conflicting in time, it's natural to choose the one that offers
 * the most profit. My solution seems more reasonable!
