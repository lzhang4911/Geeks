/**
 * Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm
 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/?p=27697
 * 
 * Time complexity: O(V^2)
 * 
 * A more efficient approach is to use adjacent list and a MinHeap (PriorityQueue),
 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/greedy-algorithms-set-7-dijkstras-algorithm-for-adjacency-list-representation/
 * O(ELogV)
 * 
 * Given an un-directed graph and a source vertex, find the shortest path
 * from the source to every possible destination vertex in the group.
 * 
 * Obviously, the distance from the source to itself is 0.
 * 
 * This problem can be resolved using the greedy method with a simple 2-D
 * array to represent the graph.
 * 
 * Greedy is because each time we only choose the vertex that has the shortest
 * distance to travel to.
